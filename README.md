Building a basic react website with dropdown navigation.

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


(Might work on further functionality, such as login and crud requests)
